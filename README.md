A platform that helps you find fake news. Co-Founded at Debug Politics, GitHub HQ.

## How it Works

This is the display site for NewsHound.

NewsHound offers 4 services to help people find fake news:

1. A chrome extention which highlights articles as you scroll through your  social media feed.
2. A journalist/fact-checker facing web app which allows them to add fake or questionable articles or news stories and automatically updates our API.
3. A user-facing web app where they can check an article's trustworthyness by simply posting the URL.
4. A mobile app which is the user-facing web app but on your phone.
